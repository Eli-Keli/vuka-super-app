# Vuka Super App (EXPERIMENT)

**Vuka** (Swahili for "to cross over") is an inclusive super app, designed from the ground up for Persons with Disabilities. Unlike traditional apps that retrofit accessibility, Vuka makes it the foundation—the entire interface adapts to individual needs.

## Mission

To build a digital platform where accessibility isn't a feature—it's the framework. To give PWDs a single, adaptive interface for all essential services.

## Current Status: Proof of Concept Complete

I've built the core adaptive engine that demonstrates the key innovation: **four distinct UI modes for the same app**.

### What Works:

- **Visual Mode**: Voice-first interface with high contrast (black/yellow)
- **Motor Mode**: Extra-large touch targets, simplified gestures  
- **Cognitive Mode**: Clean, calm interface with step-by-step flow
- **Hearing Mode**: Visual emphasis with icon-based communication
- **Profile Selection**: First-time onboarding with clear profile choices
- **Adaptive Components**: Reusable Text, Button, and Container components

## Demo Flow

1. First launch → Profile Selector
    
2. Choose profile (Visual/Motor/Cognitive/Hearing)
    
3. See Welcome Screen adapt completely
    
4. Use "Change Profile" to experience different adaptations
